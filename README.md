# Arcade Standard Specifications

## The project

The goal of this repository is to set a standard for the implementation of our [arcade](https://gitlab.com/epitech-it-2027/arcade) project.

As the goal of the **arcade** is to do arcade game and engines compliant with an other group (go check the [arcade](https://gitlab.com/epitech-it-2027/arcade) for more info) the goal of this repo is to have always the same interfaces between the two groups.

For more information about how to implement your libs, go check the doc on [mainpage](https://gitlab.com/epitech-it-2027/arcade-standard-specifications).
